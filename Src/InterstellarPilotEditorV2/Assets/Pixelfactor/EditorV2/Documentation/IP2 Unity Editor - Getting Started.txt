Note: This is a pre-alpha release version of the IP2 Editor and so this information may not yet be accurate or is likely to change!

# Welcome to the Interstellar Pilot 2 Unity Editor!

## Requirements / prequisites

It is recommended to have the standalone (Steam) version of IP2 installed. The minimum version that is supported is v2.1.0.

## Initial editor setup

### Optional - configure game executable
Goto Edit -> Project Settings -> IP2 Editor
Amend the "Game executable path" to the location of the IP2 installation. You can find this from the Steam library by going to "Manage" -> "Browse local files"

### Optional - configure export path
By default the export path is blank and scenarios are exported to Unity's temp area. You can optionally configure your own workspace location here.
**When exporting a scenario, it will overwrite any existing scenario file of the same name**

### Getting started

#### Quick export
Open one of the Unity scenes in the "SampleScenes" directory.
Export the file with "Window -> IP2 Editor -> Export -> Quick Export"
A dat file should be created and the editor should automatically open the folder location.

#### Testing
If you have configured the game executable, use "Window -> IP2 Editor -> Play" to launch the game and run the scenario.

### Best practices
- Do not edit any of the files in this package (under Pixelfactor\EditorV2). If you install a newer version of the package, these edits will be overwritten. However, you can create objects/prefabs that are based on the prefabs in this directory.
- Base your templates on the sample scenes by saving a copy into your own folder location. This will save a lot of initial setup time.
- Design single-sector or small universes initally
- Create your own prefabs to save time e.g. mixed fleet of ships, a faction with certain settings, a sector with custom appearance.
- Read the capabilities file (alongside this one) to discover what is currently possible using the editor.
- When you find a part of the editor lacking, post feedback on the Discord server so that improvements can be made
